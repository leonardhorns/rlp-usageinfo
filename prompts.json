It did help me cope with the subzero temperatures and I'm grateful. However, I also looked forward to using it as a battery pack and I was rather disappointed. I was never able to get it to charge my phone. All the cords were connected and it seemed fine but my phone never got charged. Not even for a second. Also, even when I think I've charged it fully, the light on my device continues to flash orange. Perhaps I got a faulty one. Still, it's useful as a hand warmer - I just wish I got to use it as a battery pack as well.\\\"\\nUse cases: hand warmer\\n\\nReview: \\\"I didn't expect this to be a high quality dart board but I did expect it to work. No matter how hard or soft you throw a dart, when it hits the board it drags down at least 3 inches. This is a horrible product and it is not usable in the least bit. Don't waste your money. Spend an extra $10 and get a real magnetic dart board if you still want a cheap one.\\\"\\nUse cases: No use cases\\n\\nReview: \\\"I ordered these for our restaurant's floor drains after dealing with repeated clogs and an expensive bill to have a plumber snake out the pipes.  The baskets catch all the bits of food coming out of the sinks, without impeding the flow of water.  It was necessary to remove the dome strainer from the drain in order for the basket to sit low enough for the metal grate to sit on top.  The basket is sturdy and came in white.

If you carry around a box cutter at work, or would find it convenient to do so, this is an economical way to carry one - especially when you factor in the cost of repairing your pockets or buying new pants every few weeks. January 20, 2012 After two months of pretty hard wear (by hard wear, I mean I take my cutter in and out of the holster some 30 times a day, on average, five days a week), the friction method of holding the box cutter in place has worn out. Now, if the holster is tilted or I sit down, the box cutter falls out of the holster. Pretty disappointing that it lasted only two months. I may buy another one, or several to save on shipping, but I'm going to look around some before buying again. It's still better than cutting your pocket all up, but I expect more out of products than two months of usefulness."
