# BSc2022-usageinfo

Welcome to the repository of the 2022/2023 BSc project "Usage Information for Real-Life Products".

We are a team of Bachelor students, working with the publicly available [Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html). Our goal is to find out how Machine Learning can help to extract and make sense of usage information in product reviews.

This project is supervised by Prof. Ralf Herbrich and Prof. Gerard de Melo.
